title: 'What is it?'

This basic application is designed to make it easy for you to calculate the calories and macros (protein/fat/carbs) per 100 grams of a cooked dish.

All you need to do is enter the combined weight of the raw ingredients used to make the dish, their combined macros (protein, carbs, and fat), and the cooked weight of the final dish. The app then uses this information to calculate the number of calories and macros per 100 grams of the cooked dish and display that information in the table below.

This can be especially helpful for those who are tracking their calorie and macro intake or for individuals who are trying to maintain a certain diet.
